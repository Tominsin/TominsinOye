	<p>My name is Simbiat. Today is the 17th day of July 2017. It's my first day at the boot camp for girls organised by visiola foundation.<br> I was supposed to resume by 8am but I was unable to locate the venue on time. <br>
	<p>So, the camp activities kicked off with an introduction of all participants. It took some time but it was worth it.<br> I met very interesting and amazing people. It is indeed true when it is said, "do not judge a book by its cover".</p>
